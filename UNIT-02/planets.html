          Mercury (0.307–0.588 AU (45.9–88.0 million km; 28.5–54.7 million mi)
          from the Sun) is the closest planet to the Sun. The smallest planet in
          the Solar System (0.055 ME), Mercury has no natural satellites.

          Venus (0.718–0.728 AU (107.4–108.9 million km; 66.7–67.7 million mi)
          from the Sun) is close in size to Earth (0.815 ME) and, like Earth,
          has a thick silicate mantle around an iron core, a substantial
          atmosphere, and evidence of internal geological activity. It is much
          drier than Earth, and its atmosphere is ninety times as dense. Venus
          has no natural satellites. It is the hottest planet, with surface
          temperatures over 400 °C (752 °F), mainly due to the amount of
          greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

        <dt>Earth</dt>

        <dd>
          Earth (0.983–1.017 AU (147.1–152.1 million km; 91.4–94.5 million mi)
          from the Sun) is the largest and densest of the inner planets, the
          only one known to have current geological activity, and the only place
          in the universe where life is known to exist. Its liquid hydrosphere
          is unique among the terrestrial planets, and it is the only planet
          where plate tectonics has been observed. Earth's atmosphere is
          radically different from those of the other planets, having been
          altered by the presence of life to contain 21% free oxygen.

          Mars (1.382–1.666 AU (206.7–249.2 million km; 128.5–154.9 million mi)
          from the Sun) is smaller than Earth and Venus (0.107 ME). It has an
          atmosphere of mostly carbon dioxide with a surface pressure of 6.1
          millibars (0.088 psi; 0.18 inHg); roughly 0.6% of that of Earth but
          sufficient to support weather phenomena. Its surface, peppered with
          volcanoes, such as Olympus Mons, and rift valleys, such as Valles
          Marineris, shows geological activity that may have persisted until as
          recently as 2 million years ago.

        <dt>Jupiter</dt>

        </dd>
        <dd>
          Jupiter (4.951–5.457 AU (740.7–816.4 million km; 460.2–507.3 million
          mi) from the Sun), at 318 ME, is 2.5 times the mass of all the other
          planets put together. It is composed largely of hydrogen and helium.
          Jupiter's strong internal heat creates semi-permanent features in its
          atmosphere, such as cloud bands and the Great Red Spot.
        </dd>
        <dt>Saturn</dt>
        <dd>
          <img src="https://fakeimg.pl/300x300" alt="Picture of Saturn" />
        </dd>
        <dd>
          Saturn (9.075–10.07 AU (1.3576–1.5065 billion km; 843.6–936.1 million
          mi) from the Sun), distinguished by its extensive ring system, has
          several similarities to Jupiter, such as its atmospheric composition
          and magnetosphere. Although Saturn has 60% of Jupiter's volume, it is
          less than a third as massive, at 95 ME. Saturn is the only planet of
          the Solar System that is less dense than water. The rings of Saturn
          are made up of small ice and rock particles.

        <dt>Uranus</dt>
        <dd>
          <img src="https://fakeimg.pl/300x300" alt="Picture of Uranus" />
        </dd>
        <dd>
          Uranus (18.27–20.06 AU (2.733–3.001 billion km; 1.698–1.865 billion
          mi) from the Sun), at 14 ME, has the lowest mass of the outer planets.
          Uniquely among the planets, it orbits the Sun on its side; its axial
          tilt is over ninety degrees to the ecliptic. This gives the planet
          extreme seasonal variation as each pole points toward and then away
          from the Sun. It has a much colder core than the other giant planets
          and radiates very little heat into space. As a consequence, it has the
          coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System.

        <dt>Neptune</dt>
        <dd>
          <img src="https://fakeimg.pl/300x300" alt="Picture of Neptune" />
        </dd>
        <dd>
          Neptune (29.89–30.47 AU (4.471–4.558 billion km; 2.778–2.832 billion
          mi) from the Sun), though slightly smaller than Uranus, is more
          massive (17 ME) and hence more dense. It radiates more internal heat
          than Uranus, but not as much as Jupiter or Saturn. Neptune has 14
          known satellites. The largest, Triton, is geologically active, with
          geysers of liquid nitrogen. Triton is the only large satellite with a
          retrograde orbit, which indicates that it did not form with Neptune,
          but was probably captured from the Kuiper belt.

          The Sun is the Solar System's star and by far its most massive
          component. Its large mass (332,900 Earth masses), which comprises
          99.86% of all the mass in the Solar System, produces temperatures and
          densities in its core high enough to sustain nuclear fusion of
          hydrogen into helium. This releases an enormous amount of energy,
          mostly radiated into space as electromagnetic radiation peaking in
          visible light.

        <dt>Pluto</dt>

        <dd>
          The dwarf planet Pluto (with an average orbit of 39 AU (5.8 billion
          km; 3.6 billion mi) from the Sun) is the largest known object in the
          Kuiper belt. When discovered in 1930, it was considered to be the
          ninth planet; this changed in 2006 with the adoption of a formal
          definition of planet. Pluto has a relatively eccentric orbit inclined
          17 degrees to the ecliptic plane and ranging from 29.7 AU (4.44
          billion km; 2.76 billion mi) from the Sun at perihelion (within the
          orbit of Neptune) to 49.5 AU (7.41 billion km; 4.60 billion mi) at
          aphelion. Pluto has a 2:3 resonance with Neptune, meaning that Pluto
          orbits twice round the Sun for every three Neptunian orbits.
