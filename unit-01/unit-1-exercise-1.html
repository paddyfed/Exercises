    Most tags, such as the HTML and /HTML tags that surround the contents of
    a page, come in pairs; some tags, like HR, for a horizontal rule, stand 
    alone. Comments, such as the text you're reading, are not displayed when
    the Web page is shown. The information between the HEAD and /HEAD tags is 
    not displayed. The information between the BODY and /BODY tags is displayed.
